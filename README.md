# Introduction
Welcome to the Mars Weather Analysis project conducted by Ashley Ley, a Data Analyst at SpaceX. In this project, we aim to delve into the weather data collected on Mars, specifically focusing on the information gathered by the Curiosity rover. Our objective is to gain insights into the Martian weather patterns, temperatures, atmospheric pressures, and other related factors. 

## Dataset
A comprehensive dataset collected by the Curiousity Rover contained weather information from the rover's operations on Mars. This dataset encompasses a range of parameters including temperatures, atmospheric pressures, and other environmental factors, collected over a specific period.

## Data Analysis
### Coldest and Warmest Months
We undertook an analysis to identify the coldest and warmest months on Mars at the location of the Curiosity rover. This involved calculating the average minimum daily temperature for each month and subsequently plotting the results as a bar chart. It was found that the coldest month on Mars was 'Month 3' and the warmest month on Mars was 'Month 8'

### Atmospheric Pressure Analysis
To uncover the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressures on Mars, we computed the average daily atmospheric pressure across all months. Our findings were visually depicted through a bar chart to enhance understanding.

### Terrestrial Days in a Martian Year
Answering the intriguing question of how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year, we evaluated the Earth days required for Mars to complete its orbit around the Sun. We supported this estimation by plotting the daily minimum temperature data.

# Conclusion
Through meticulous data analysis using Pandas functions, along with the utilization of web scraping tools such as Splinter and BeautifulSoup, we have gained valuable insights into Mars' weather patterns and related factors. This project our commitment to exploring innovative techniques to gather and analyze data in the realm of space exploration.
